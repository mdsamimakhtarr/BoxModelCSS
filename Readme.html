what is flex box?
 flexbox is a one dimanesion layout model that allows you to design a layout structure without using float or positioning. It is a powerful tool for creating responsive layouts and aligning items within a container.
Flexbox stands for "Flexible Box Layout" and is a CSS layout mode that provides an efficient way to arrange items within a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. It allows for the distribution of space along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically) and provides control over alignment, direction, and order of the items.
 it is ued space among items in a row horizontally or vertically. Flexbox is particularly useful for creating responsive designs, as it allows items to adjust their size and position based on the available space in the container.

if we want to change direction to column  

option for justify contain :box-sizing
justify-content: flex-start; /* Default, items are packed toward the start of the flex container */
justify-content: flex-end; /* Items are packed toward the end of the flex container */
justify-content: center; /* Items are centered in the flex container */
justify-content: space-between; /* Items are evenly distributed in the flex container, with the first item at the start and the last item at the end */
justify-content: space-around; /* Items are evenly distributed in the flex container, with equal space around each item */
justify-content: space-evenly; /* Items are evenly distributed in the flex container, with equal space between them */
   


 option for align items :box-sizing:
align-items: flex-start; /* Items are aligned at the start of the cross axis */
align-items: flex-end; /* Items are aligned at the end of the cross axis */
align-items: center; /* Items are centered in the cross axis */
align-items: baseline; /* Items are aligned along their baseline */

.box{
   flex 1;
   margin :6px; /// all boxes grow equally to fill the available space.
}

How do you define three equal width columns in a grid layout?

To define three equal width columns in a grid layout, you can use the `grid-template-columns` property with the value `repeat(3, 1fr)`. This creates three columns, each taking up one fraction of the available space.

Example:
.grid-container{
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* Creates three equal width columns */
  gap: 10px; /* Optional: adds space between grid items */
}


How do you make a grid iteam span two columns?

To make a grid item span two columns, you can use the `grid-column` property with the value `span 2`. This tells the grid item to occupy two columns in the grid layout.  


Example:
.grid-item {
  grid-column: span 2; /* This item will span two columns */
}

 

repeat():

grid grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* Creates three equal width columns */

it creates three equal columns then 1fr means one fraction of available space .

grid-template-rows: repeat(auto-fit, minmax (150px )); 

it adjust the number of columns based on the screen width <div class="
"></div>

minmax():
it saids min and max size  for each iteam;
